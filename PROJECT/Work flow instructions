Hardware configuration

Software configuration:

  Basic components: 

        1. bin2seg
        2. clock_enable
        3. debounce

  Components:
  
        1. adjusting bin2seg for two segments
        2. adjusting debounce for one button for START/STOP
        3. adjusting clock_enable for specific time
        4. creating timer 0 - 60 seconds, than starts over
        5. creating signals with different frequency, 4 signals with frequency of tones A,E,C,D

  TestBench:
        Simulations for different components
        testing displaying numbers
        correct the fequency of different signals
        set wanted time of signals

  Board implementation:

  Creating final top_level
    1. setting inputs and outputs
    2. setting signals between components

    Idea:

BTNC button will start the timer, with turning on a switch one of relays starts clicking in specific frequency
By turning on other switch will start other relay click in another frequency
BTNC can also stop the timer and the switches won`t be active
BTND will restart the timer if wanted, after 60 seconds the timer starts over again.
LEDS indicates if signal is active or not
